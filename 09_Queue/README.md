# Queue in C++

This folder contains the implementation of Queue data structure in C++ along with important interview and coding problems based on queues.

Queue follows the **FIFO (First In First Out)** principle, where the element inserted first is removed first.

## Topics Covered

- Queue using Array  
- Queue using Linked List  
- Queue using STL (`std::queue`)  
- Circular Queue  
- Deque (Double Ended Queue)  
- Priority Queue (`std::priority_queue`)  
- Implement Queue using Stack  
- First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream  
- Sliding Window Maximum  


Queue-based problems are very common in coding interviews and competitive programming.
