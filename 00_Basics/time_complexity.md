# Time Complexity & Space Complexity (C++)

Understanding **time complexity** and **space complexity** is essential for writing efficient programs and cracking coding interviews.

---

## ⏱️ What is Time Complexity?

Time complexity measures **how the runtime of an algorithm grows** as the input size increases.

It is expressed using **Big-O notation**.

👉 It does NOT measure actual time in seconds  
👉 It measures **growth rate**

---

## 📦 What is Space Complexity?

Space complexity measures **extra memory used** by an algorithm (excluding input).

Includes:
- Variables
- Arrays
- Recursion stack

## 🔢 Common Time Complexities

| Big-O Notation | Name | Example |
|---------------|------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant | Accessing array element |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary Search |
| O(n) | Linear | Traversing array |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge Sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Nested loops |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci |
