# Pointers in C++

In C++, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a data value directly, it "points" to the location in memory where the actual data is stored. 

This folder covers fundamental to intermediate pointer concepts in C++.

## Topics Covered
- Pointer basics & dereferencing
- Pointer arithmetic
- Pointers and arrays
- Pointer to pointer
- Call by reference using pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation
- NULL, void & dangling pointers

Pointers are crucial for understanding memory management and advanced data structures.
