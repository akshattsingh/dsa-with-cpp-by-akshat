This folder contains implementation of Binary Tree concepts from basic to advanced level using C++.

## Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Basic Concepts
- Binary Tree Creation
- Tree Node Structure

### 2️⃣ Tree Traversals (DFS)
- Inorder Traversal
- Preorder Traversal
- Postorder Traversal

### 3️⃣ Level Order Traversal (BFS)
- Using Queue

### 4️⃣ Important Tree Problems
- Height of Tree
- Diameter of Tree (Optimized)
- Check Balanced Tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
